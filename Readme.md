Project: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) System with Secure Authentication


This project is a Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system built with React, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. The application ensures secure user management, where users are assigned specific roles—User, Moderator, and Admin—with distinct access permissions. The system uses JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication and includes several advanced features such as token blacklisting, form validation, secure password hashing, and role-based dashboard views.

Key Features:

1. Secure Authentication & Authorization:
JWT Authentication: The system uses JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure authentication. Upon login, a token is generated and stored in local storage to authenticate subsequent requests.
Token Expiry: The JWT token has a default expiration time of one hour, ensuring that the token is refreshed or revalidated periodically.
Token Blacklisting: When a user logs out or when a token expires, the token is blacklisted to prevent unauthorized access with a stale token.
Password Hashing: All passwords are securely hashed using bcrypt before being stored in the MongoDB database, ensuring that sensitive data is protected.

2. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):
Admin Role: Admin users have the highest level of privileges. They can:
View and manage all users, including both User and Moderator roles.
Promote any user to Moderator or Admin, or demote a Moderator back to User.
Moderator Role: Moderators can:
View only Users (excluding other Moderators and Admins).
Promote a User to a Moderator, but they cannot see or modify other Moderators or Admins.
User Role: Regular users have limited access and can only see their own data.


3. Dynamic Dashboard Views:
The Dashboard page is tailored based on the user's role:
Admin sees all users (including Moderators and Users) and can perform role assignments and modifications.
Moderator sees only Users and can promote them to Moderators, but cannot see Admins or Moderators.
User sees only their personal data and cannot modify roles.

4. Form Validation:
Frontend Validation: Forms on the front end, such as registration and login, are validated using React validation libraries (e.g., Formik, React Hook Form) to ensure that input data is correct and meets the required criteria before submitting to the backend.
Backend Validation: All incoming data is also validated on the server side to prevent malicious or invalid data from being processed. This includes user credentials, roles, and other sensitive data.


5. 404 Page and Error Handling:
If a user tries to access any invalid route or URL that doesn't exist, the system will show a 404 Page Not Found to inform them of the invalid URL.
Error handling is implemented to display proper error messages when things go wrong, such as failed authentication, invalid token, or a failed database operation.


6. Logout and Token Blacklisting:
When a user logs out, their JWT token is blacklisted to prevent reuse and ensure that no further requests are allowed with the same token.
The logout process ensures that the token is invalidated in the backend using a blacklist mechanism.


7. Database & Backend Implementation:
The backend is built using Node.js and Express, with data stored in a MongoDB database.
User roles are defined in the database schema, and the auth middleware enforces role-based access by checking the user’s role before granting access to protected routes.

8. UI/UX Design:
The front end is styled using TailwindCSS, providing a modern and responsive user interface.
The UI dynamically adjusts based on the user’s role, showing different content and options based on the permissions.



9. Security Enhancements:
JWT Expiry: The JWT tokens expire after one hour to mitigate the risk of long-lived tokens being misused.
Blacklisted Tokens: Tokens that are logged out or expired are blacklisted, preventing unauthorized access with a stale or compromised token.
Secure Password Storage: Passwords are hashed before being stored, ensuring that even if the database is compromised, user credentials remain safe.
Project Structure:
Frontend (React)
Role-Based Views: Dynamically rendered views based on the user's role (Admin, Moderator, User).
Authentication: Users log in, and tokens are stored in local storage to maintain session.
Dashboard: A user-friendly dashboard to manage users based on role-specific permissions.
Backend (Node.js/Express/MongoDB)
Role-based Middleware: Enforces access control by checking the user’s role in the request header (JWT).
JWT Authentication: Secures API routes with JWT tokens, blacklists expired tokens, and supports user authentication and authorization.
MongoDB: Stores user data and role information. The backend allows for role modifications (promotion and demotion) and manages user access based on role.
